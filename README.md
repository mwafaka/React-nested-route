### Nested Navigations

- Nested navigations refer to the concept of having multiple levels of navigation within a web application.
- It allows you to create a hierarchical structure of routes and navigation links, where certain routes can contain sub-routes and have their own set of navigation links.

- This can be useful when building complex applications with nested components or sections that require separate navigation within each level.


### Creating a Navigation bar with `<NavLink>`

- A special version of the <Link> that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.


### Redirecting components: `<Navigate>`

Sometimes, you may need

-  to redirect a user to a different page or component based on certain conditions.
-  The `<Navigate>` component provided by `react-router-dom` allows you to achieve this redirection.
